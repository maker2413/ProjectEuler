The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
#+END_EXAMPLE

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
#+END_EXAMPLE

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is =3025= - =385= = =2640=.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

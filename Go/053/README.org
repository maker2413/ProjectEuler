There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, =12345=:
=123=, =124=, =125=, =134=, =135=, =145=, =234=, =235=, =245=, and =345=

In combinatorics, we use the notation, =(5 3)= = =10=.

In general, =(n r)= = ={n!}= / ={r!(n-r)!}=, where =r= less than or equal to
=n=, =n!= = =n= * =(n-1)= * ... * =3= * =2= * =1=, and =0!= = =1=.

It is not until =n= = =23=, that a value exceeds one-million: =({23} {10})= =
=1144066=.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of =(n r)= for =1= less than or equal
to =n= less than or equal to =100=, are greater than one-million?

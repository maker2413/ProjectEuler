The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), where =f_1= = =1= and =f_2= = =1=.

Hence the first =12= terms will be:
=1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144=

The 12th term, =f_12=, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain =1000=
digits?

I had to consult a this guide to complete the problem:
